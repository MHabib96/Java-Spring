# What is Spring Boot?
---

A 'convention-over-configuration' solution for creating stand-alone Spring based applications. Works as a simple 'Plug and Play'.
Takes an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries to help get started with minimum fuss. (Very little configuration) 

Features
* Create stand-alone Spring applications
* Embed Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow directly (no need to deploy WAR files)
* Provide opinionated 'starter' POMs to simplify your Maven configuration
* Automatically configure Spring whenever possible
* Provide production-ready features such as metrics, health checks and externalized configuration
* Absolutely no code generation and no requirement for XML configuration

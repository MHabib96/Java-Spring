# ASP.NET MVC 5 Tutorial - Entity Framework
##### What is Entity Framework?
+ Entity framework is a tool we use to access the database.
+ It is classified as an Object/Relational Mapper, this means it maps data in a relational database into object of our application.
+ With an Object/Relational Mapper you are able to work at a higher level of abstraction.
##### DbContext
+ Entity Framework provides a class called DbContext which is a gateway to our database.
+ DbSet's represent tables in the database. 
+ A DbContext has one or more DbSet's.
##### LINQ
+ LINQ is used to query these DbSets.
+ An Entity Framework will translate the LINQ queries to SQL queries at runtime.
##### Entity Framework
+ The framework opens a connection to the database, reads the data, maps it to objects, and adds them to DbSet's in the DbContext.
+ As you Add/Modify/Delete objects in DbSet's, the Entity Framework keeps track of such changes.
+ When we ask the framework to persist the changes, it will automatically generate SQL statements and executes them on the database.
##### Workflows
+ There are two different workflows that you could use to work with the Entity Framework.
+ They are *Database First* and *Code First*.
